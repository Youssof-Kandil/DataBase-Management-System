# DataBase-Management-System
Developed a Database management system (DBMS) from the ground up using only java, It can Create indexes on tables and supports multiple data types. It has Efficiency measures Applied to it  Like paging to ensure Memory isn't monopolized while executing queries.

<h4> What the DBMS Does in Detail: </h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Supports 4 datatypes (strings, integers, doubles, dates) and uses the strategy design pattern to allow for adding more data types easily.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Stores pages and indicies in serialized object files, and uses strategy design pattern to make it easier to support other storage strategies.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Supports multi dimensional queries, range or partial queries using an Octree index.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Uses both the factory and strategy design patterns to allow supporting more indices easily.
Saves metadata about tables in a CSV format, and uses strategy pattern to easily support other formats in the futures.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
